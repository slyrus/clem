1. Figure out how to properly do integer division for gaussian blur in
   bench-matrix.cl.

2. DONE --  make metaclass for matrices to better handle type stuff
   now we have a standard-matrix-class metaclass that handles much of
   the type information.

3. Remove specialized-matrix-class stuff and replace abstract matrix
   types (like real-matrix, integer-matrix, float-matrix) with
   subclasses of standard-matrix-class.

4. DONE -- (element-type matrix) is wrong! we should go through the
   metaclass on this and not have this be part of the class at all!
   element-type is now only part of the metaclass. I think.

5. Try inlining the functions to avoid all of the type declarations!
   This doesn't work. I think I need the type declarations to make
   this go fast.

6. DONE -- Make a type moved-element function that moves an element from one
   matrix to another with things properly typed, coerced, etc...
   This is at least partially done and works well enough, although the
   list of supported matrices is minimal. However, it is trivial to
   add more type conversions.

7. DONE -- This is a dup of 6. Need a better mechanism for creating,
populating, copying and converting to and from matrices of a given
type. How to create matrices of the following types:

double-float
single-float
unsigned-byte
signed-byte
unsigned-word
signed-word
bit (or whatever the appropriate one bit type is)

8. Need to set/get values from a given matrix type appropriately. This
   is done now with mref which works in some cases, but not in all
   cases. Should mref be a funciton that gets compiled for each
   subclass and stored as a class allocated slot or in the metaclass?

9. IN PROGRESS. scalar-ops should work between matrices of different types. Slowly
   adding these. add and subtract now work for most types.

10. IN PROGRES. Need to be able to convert from one matrix type to
    another. I have a bunch of these.

11. DONE, I THINK. random-matrix should work. This should be working now.

12. DONE. need functions to create a matrix of the same type, and of
    the same type and dimensions. Yes, this could be more elegant, but
    I think it works at the moment.

13. DONE. shared-initialize Ok, so being new to CL, I didn't know
    about shared-initialize (and initialize-instance and
    re-initialize-instance) so I didn't know how to get slots
    initialized via make-instance. Now I now all this so I need to
    remove the hacked up constructor functions I made and replace
    everything with calls to make-instance.

14. DONE. rename unsinged-{byte,word,long} to ub{8,16,32}, etc...

15. mat-copy-proto needs to die a horrible death. replace these
    instances with more type-aware, or at least optionally more
    type-aware matrix creation functions.
